# GUIDELINES:
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Owners bear a responsibility to the organization and the users of this
# application. Repository administrators have the ability to merge pull
# requests that have not yet received the requisite reviews as outlined
# in this file. Do not force merge any PR without confidence that it
# follows all policies or without full understanding of the impact of
# those changes on build, release and publishing outcomes.
#
# The CODEOWNERS file constitutes an agreement amongst organisation
# admins and maintainers to restrict approval capabilities to a subset
# of contributors. Modifications to this file result in a modification of
# that agreement and can only be approved by those with the knowledge
# and responsibility to publish libraries under the MetaMask name.
